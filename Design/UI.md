User interface design
=====================

The user interface should be clean, but with some complexity, to allow for awesomeness.

My initial design
-----------------

```
[===================================]
|             Window 1              |
[===================================]
| Window text.                      |
| More text.                        |
|                                   |
| 1. Menu                           |
| 2. Items                          |
|                                   |
|                                   |
|   [Button]  [Again]               |
|                                   |
[===================================]
Select[B, A, 1, 2]: _
```

I think it could be improved, but this is what I've got right now.
